    Mad Manager
</h1>

A simple, lightweight and open source mod manager for Mad Max on PC.

## How to use it
Get the [latest version from here](https://github.com/AxiusV/Mad-Manager/releases) and run `Mad Manager.exe`.

Not tested on Linux/Steam Deck. Since it's a **.py**, you could use it there without problems.

After lauching it, a Mods folder will be created in the .exe location. Select the location of Mad Max's main folder. Put any mod in the Mods folder. Now simply enable mods with their respective toggles.

## How to release mods for this

The structure for mods must be Mod_Main_folder/dropzone. Inside dropzone you just put all the necessary file(s) and folder(s) for the mod to work. It's the same process for converting mods to this mod manager. The app will automatically copy the files and folders from mod's dropzone folder to the game's one after enabling it. Disabling mods makes the app automatically delete it's content from the game's dropzone folder.
