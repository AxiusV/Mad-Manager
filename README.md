    Mad Manager
</h1>

A simple and lightweight mod manager for Mad Max on PC.

## How to use it
Get the [latest version from GitHub](https://github.com/AxiusV/Mad-Manager/releases) and run `Mad Manager.exe`.

Not tested on Linux/Steam Deck. Since it's a **.py**, you could use it there without problems.

After lauching it, a **''Mods''** folder will be created in it's .exe location. Select the location of Mad Max's main folder.
Put any mod in the **''Mods''** folder. Now simply enable mods by checking it's checkbox and click ''Save''.

## How to release mods for this

The structure for mods must be **Mod_Main_folder/dropzone**. Inside **''dropzone''** you just put all the necessary file(s)/folder(s) for the mod to work. It's the same process for converting mods to this mod manager.
